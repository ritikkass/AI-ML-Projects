# AI and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains six AI/ML projects that demonstrate different applications of machine learning and deep learning. Each project includes code, a brief explanation, and instructions for running it.

## 1. Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

### Description
A neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies: pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
2. Run mnist_digit_recognition.py to train and test the model.

## 2. Movie Recommendation System

### Description
A recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on descriptions.

### Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies: pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Place movies.csv (with columns: title, description) in the project folder.
3. Run movie_recommendation.py and enter a movie title to get recommendations.

## 4. Fake News Detector

### Description
A logistic regression model to classify news articles as real or fake using NLP techniques.

### Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies: pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Place news.csv (with columns: text, label) in the project folder.
3. Run fake_news_detector.py to train and evaluate the model.

## 6. Stock Price Prediction

### Description
An LSTM-based neural network that predicts stock prices based on historical data.

### Installation & Usage
1. Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
2. Place stock_prices.csv (with a Close column) in the project folder.
3. Run stock_price_prediction.py to train and predict stock prices.
